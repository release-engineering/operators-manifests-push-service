### Uploading operators manifests from zipfile

Operator manifests files must be added to zip archive

#### Endpoints

* [POST] `/v1/<organization>/<repository>/zipfile/<version>`
* [POST] `/v1/<organization>/<repository>/zipfile`

Zip file must be attached as `content_type='multipart/form-data'` assigned to
field `file`. See `curl` examples bellow.

If `<version>` is omitted:
* the latest release version will be incremented and used (for example from `2.5.1` to `3.0.0`)
* for new repository a default initial version will be used (`DEFAULT_RELEASE_VERSION` config option)

`<version>` must be unique for repository. Quay doesn't support overwriting of releases.
